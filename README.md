  <strong>A basic Flutter application providing reviews of searched movies/shows</strong>
</h3>


## 📌 Key Features

* **Search Functionality**: Easily search for review of the movie/show you desire to watch using the integrated search bar.
  
* **Collections**: I have made collections of top movies from each major genres in case you don't know what to watch(common issue).

* **Comprehensive Information**: Get comprehensive details including IMDb ratings, plot summaries, cast members, and directors of the searched movies/shows.

* **Light and Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark mode with a simple toggle.

## 🔖 Note

* The application is most likely to be developed further, any suggestions regarding the appearance or funtionality of the application will be much appreciated.
* This application was developed as an excercise to sharpen flutter/dart skills, therefore I do not expect the code or the application to be the best version of the intended project.
