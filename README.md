## 📕 Note

* The application is most likely to be developed further, any suggestions regarding the appearance or funtionality of the application will be much appreciated.
* This application was developed as an excercise to sharpen flutter/dart skills, therefore I do not expect the code or the application to be the best version of the intended project.
